By default tfstate file will get created in config directory by default.
Benefits of tfstate:
mapping config to real world
Tracking matadat
performance
Collaboration


If local state file and collaboration is not maintained . Also should not save it in VCS and will occure security issue .
As its recommended only 1 person perform operation on state file at a time
if both will perform concurrent operation issue will come

Like we perform concurrent operation in local will get below error:
"Error locking state: Error acquired the state file :Resource temp unavailable"

This feature is called state locking 
VCS does not allow state locking might cause data and infra loss


Recommended to store in remote state backend --S3 , cloud
