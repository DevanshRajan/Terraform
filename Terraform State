terraform.tfstate
Whihch will get create as consequence of terraform apply command

json data structure which maps real world infra resources to resource defn in configuration file.
consider as single source of truth for terraform plan and apply command

-----------------------------------------------
Purpose of state
--> It can be considered as a blueprint of all the resources that are manage out there in real world
--> In case of removing both dependent blocks from main.tf , terraform apply command relies on metadat available in terraform state file and perform destroy as per order
--> terraform plan --refresh=false
The -refresh=false option is used in normal planning mode to skip the default behavior of refreshing Terraform state before checking for configuration changes.

-----------------------------------------------

Recommended to store state file in remote data store , rather than to rely on local copy 

-----------------------------------------------

Terraform state consideration:
Its a single source of truth for Terraform to understand what is deployed in real world.
State is a non optional feature in terraform
It strore sensitive information like ip add, ssh key pair or pwds so should be store in a secure storage
tfstate file should be Stored in S3 or terraform cloud
main.tf can be stored in VCS
Not recommended to make changes manually in tfstate file however sometime there will be situation we have to do that in that case will rely on state commands.
